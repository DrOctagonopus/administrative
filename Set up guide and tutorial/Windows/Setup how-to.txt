0. Create an account on GitHub.com
1. Install git for windows.
--Change default selection of windows explorer integration (we don't need this)
2. Install TortoiseGIT
3. Create SSH key (authentication of your computer to the repos)
--Start > PuTTy > Generate Private SSH key
--Generate a key
--Move the mouse around to generate some entropy
--Save the private and public keys in a secure location on your computer.
--Copy the public key from the box to the clipboard
--Open your settings in GitHub
--Add a new key. Give it a name you want, paste the key in, and save it.
4. TortoiseGIT > Settings > Git > Credentials > Enable wincred - this account (this will make it so you only put in your credentials once)
--if you have 2FA enabled, then you can create a token in GitHub and use that as a one-time password.
5. Go to the repo you want to clone on GitHub. Find the url at the bottom right (ends in .git) and copy that.
--Right click in windows explorer and clone a repo. Paste the one you are using. Make sure the ssh key is loaded.
--Confirm the files came in.
6. Make changes. Commit. Push. Put in your username and password once, and next time it shouldn't need it again.
